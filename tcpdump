Summary of tcpdump Options

There is a full list of options in the tcpdump Documentation.

-i specifies the network interface to monitor

-D lists the available interfaces to monitor (for use with -i)

-n indicates that tcpdump should use numeric values for IP addresses and ports instead of DNS pointer records

-w writes the captured data to a pcap file

-r reads data from a pcap file


Use case: 

While capturing live traffic in one terminal window, you can open another terminal window and generate some network traffic. This example will send 3 ping requests to one of Google's nameservers:

ping -c 3 8.8.8.8

To write the captured packets to a file, use the -w option:
 sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n proto 1 -w ping.pcap
You can read captured packets from a file using the -r option:
 sudo tcpdump -i enp0s3 -n -r ping.pcap
